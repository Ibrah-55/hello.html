       <h6>I am a Computer Scientist. </h6>
       As far as am concerned this is all that matters. I thought at first I would probably become an Electrical Enginer until I discovered I wanted to venture into computers.
       <p>That's when my brother introduced me into Programming.It seemed too hard at first.I read several books and I kept on forgetting, or mybe I thought I was too young for this.Or lemme summarise this, I am now doing well. Thanks to <em>CS50</em>
       I will now share what I have learnt about Computers and being a Computer Scientist.
       <em>Computer Science (CS)</em> is the study of the principles and use of computers. Simply put it's the science that deals with the theory and methods of processing information in digital computers, the design of computer hardware and software, and the applications of computers. A computer is simply a tool for a computer scientist, like a telescope for an astronomer.</p>
